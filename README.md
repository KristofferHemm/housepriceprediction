This project consists of a classification task.\
The task is to predict which of 3 price classes a property in the city belongs to.\

The dataset for this project consists of property data from Melbourne.\
The features are a mix of continuous and categorical variables.\
The target feature is unbalanced, so we need to use macro f1 score as the training metric.
