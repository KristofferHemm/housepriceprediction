## Project description
This project consists of a classification task.\
The task is to predict which of 3 price classes a property in the city belongs to.

The dataset for this project consists of property data from Melbourne.\
The features are a mix of continuous and categorical variables.\
The target feature is unbalanced, so using macro f1 score as the training metric is the natural choice. However, when training the models it became apparent that using accuracy as the training metric gave better results.
